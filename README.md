## WS and OSC Framework Snapshot

This is propably always going to be a collection of snapshots. This should be a working example of a combined Websocket and osc interfacing with unity.

## Manual: 

There IS some amount of documentation to this project, but to keep this relatively minimal.
General concepts are described there. I've tried to explain certain decisions.

(yes, includes cretdis)

## Compatibility: 

Code should work fine in 2017.4. Example scene - not so much
In case of duplicate extensions - feel free to delete ones supplied here.
